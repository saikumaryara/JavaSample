 * @Version 15 I want to sort objects based on properties using comparable u can
 *          developed default sorting order logic along with the object i.e we
 *          can sort only single element suc as sno,id,name ...etc

/*
 * As per my understanding I think:
 * 
 * It is perfectly legal for two objects to have the same hashcode. If two
 * objects are equal (using the equals() method) then they have the same
 * hashcode. If two objects are not equal then they cannot have the same
 * hashcode
 * 
 * A hashmap works like this (this is a little bit simplified, but it
 * illustrates the basic mechanism):
 * 
 * It has a number of "buckets" which it uses to store key-value pairs in. Each
 * bucket has a unique number - that's what identifies the bucket. When you put
 * a key-value pair into the map, the hashmap will look at the hash code of the
 * key, and store the pair in the bucket of which the identifier is the hash
 * code of the key. For example: The hash code of the key is 235 -> the pair is
 * stored in bucket number 235. (Note that one bucket can store more then one
 * key-value pair).
 * 
 * When you lookup a value in the hashmap, by giving it a key, it will first
 * look at the hash code of the key that you gave. The hashmap will then look
 * into the corresponding bucket, and then it will compare the key that you gave
 * with the keys of all pairs in the bucket, by comparing them with equals().
 * 
 * Now you can see how this is very efficient for looking up key-value pairs in
 * a map: by the hash code of the key the hashmap immediately knows in which
 * bucket to look, so that it only has to test against what's in that bucket.
 * 
 * Looking at the above mechanism, you can also see what requirements are
 * necessary on the hashCode() and equals() methods of keys:
 * 
 * If two keys are the same (equals() returns true when you compare them), their
 * hashCode() method must return the same number. If keys violate this, then
 * keys that are equal might be stored in different buckets, and the hashmap
 * would not be able to find key-value pairs (because it's going to look in the
 * same bucket).
 * 
 * If two keys are different, then it doesn't matter if their hash codes are the
 * same or not. They will be stored in the same bucket if their hash codes are
 * the same, and in this case, the hashmap will use equals() to tell them apart.

 * Can you explain it is going to look in the same bucket say those two equals
 * objects are t1 and t2 and they are equal and t1 and t2 have hashcodes h1 and
 * h2 respectively .So t1.equals(t2)=true and h1!=h2 So when the hashmap would
 * look for t1 , it will look in the bucket h1 and for t2 in the bucket t2 ? –
 * Geek Jul 19 '12 at 16:14 20 If two keys are equal but their hashCode() method
 * returns different hash codes, then the equals() and hashCode() methods of the
 * key class violate the contract and you'll get strange results when using
 * those keys in a HashMap. – Jesper Oct 10 '12 at 15:21 Each bucket can have
 * multiple Key Values pairs, which are uses linked list internally. But my
 * confusion is - what is bucket here? What data structure it uses internally?
 * Is there any connection between buckets? – Ankit Sharma Jul 2 '14 at 6:57 1
 * 
 * @AnkitSharma If you want to really know all the details, lookup the source
 * code of HashMap, which you can find in the file src.zip in your JDK
 * installation directory. – Jesper Jul 2 '14 at 7:04 2

 * @1290 The only relation between the keys in the same bucket is that they have
 * the same hash code. –
