1) Need of this chapter?
		- used for developing reusable logic tor perform one operation
		- that operation can be a mathematical operation or
		- can be be business operation
		
		- upto variables chapter we have learn storing data,
		- now we must learn performing operations by using that data

		- we will  perform muitiple operation 
		- we must develop logic for each operation separately 
		
		- for this purpose we need new PE, that is method

2) Why do we need create our own method, when we have main method already?
		-We can place logic inside main method, but it is not reusable
		- because
			1. It name is fixed, its paramter is fixed, its return type is fixed, its modifiers fixed
			2. we can not separate one operation to another operation logic

		- In order to develop logic in reusable way by separating from other operations logic
		- we must develop our own method, user defined method or custom method

class  Addition{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = 10;
		int b = 20;

		//addition logic
		int c = a + b;
		System.out.println(c);

		//sutraction logic
		int d = a - b;
		System.out.println(d);

		//multiplication logic
		int e = a * b;
		System.out.println(e);
